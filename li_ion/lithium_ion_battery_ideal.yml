  Cantera input file for an LCO/graphite lithium-ion battery

  This file includes a full set of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of a
  lithium-ion battery, in particular:
  - Active materials: LiCoO2 (LCO) and LiC6 (graphite)
  - Organic electrolyte: EC/PC with 1M LiPF6
  - Interfaces: LCO/electrolyte and LiC6/electrolyte
  - Charge-transfer reactions at the two interfaces

  We use Butler-Volmer kinetics by setting `exchange-current-density-formulation`
  to `true`. The preexponential factors and activation energies are converted
  from Guo et al., J. Electrochem. Soc. 158, A122 (2011)

  A MATLAB example using this file for simulating a discharge curve is
  samples/matlab/lithium_ion_battery.m
