  Cantera input file for LFP-solid Li anode battery

  This file includes a full set of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of a
  lithium-ion battery, in particular:
  - Active materials: LiFePO4 (LFP) and Li (solid Li)
  - Organic electrolyte: EC/PC with 1M LiPF6
  - Interfaces: LFP/electrolyte and Li/electrolyte
  - Charge-transfer reactions at the two interfaces

  We use a range of kinetic models: Butler-Volmer, Marcus-Hush, and Marcus-Hush-Chidsey.  
  - Li anode parameters are obtained by fitting to data from D. T. Boyle, X. Kong, A. Pei, P. E. Rudnicki, F. Shi, W. Huang, Z. Bao, J. Qin, and Y. Cui, ACS Energy Lett. 5, 701 (2020).
  - LFP cathode parameters are adapted from Y. Zeng, R. B. Smith, P. Bai, and M. Z. Bazant, J. Elec- troanal. Chem. 735, 77 (2014).

  Thermodynamics are tuned to match the experimentally-measured OCP value.
